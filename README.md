# [Project - 1: Hospitality Data Analysis](https://jigneshs6701.github.io/Jignesh_Sharma_Portfolio/)

## Description 
This self-driven hospitality project makes use of the power of POWER BI and Excel to uncover revenue opportunities. The project examines online data to identify key indicators such as RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy%, Realisation%, RevPar, DBRN, DSRN, and DURN. The findings of this study pave the way for more effective revenue strategies in the hospitality industry.

## Key Performance Indicator(KPIs)  Explained 

1. Occupancy % - Occupancy % represents the percentage of available rooms that are occupied by guests.
                 A higher occupancy rate indicates better utilization of hotel rooms and increased revenue potential.

2. ADR (Average Daily Rate) -  ADR is the average rate charged per room, typically calculated as total room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold.
                                A high ADR reflects the pricing strategy's effectiveness and the hotel's ability to command higher room rates.

3. Realisation % - Realisation % compares the actual revenue earned to the maximum potential revenue under ideal conditions.
                   A high realisation percentage signifies efficient revenue management practices.

4. RevPar(Revenue Per Available Room) - RevPar is calculated by multiplying ADR by Occupancy % and indicates the revenue generated per available room.
                                        A higher RevPar indicates both pricing and occupancy performance.

 5. DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights) - DBRN tells on average how many rooms are booked for a day considering a time period and it is calculated by Dividing Total Bookings to No of Days.

 6. DURN(Daily Usable Room Nights) - DURB tells on average how many are succesfully utilized by customer for a day considering a time period and it is calculated Total Checked Out to No of Days.

 7. DSRN(Daily Sellable Room Nights) - DSRN tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period and it is calculated dividing Total Capacity to No of Days.

## Insights 
1. We observed  that the business class rating in hotels is so low that we need to improve our service towards  business class hotels.

2. By seeing key metric graph chart ,  the ADR (Average Daily Rate) is the same on weekdays and weekends, there is a suggestion that they raise their room prices on weekends. 

3. Revenue from online travel sites such as MakemyTrip and others fell by 0.1%. 

4. Revenue is increasing in the Luxury class while decreasing in the Business class.

5. We receive high revenue from Mumbai, while receiving low revenue from Delhi.

# [Project - 2: FMCG Supply Chain Analysis with Power BI and Excel ](https://jigneshs6701.github.io/Jignesh_Sharma_Portfolio/)

## Description 

To address supply chain issues, this self-driven project in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) department uses POWER BI and Excel. The project analyses online data to determine key performance indicators (KPIs) such as OT%, IF%, LIFR (Line Fill Rate), VOFR (Volume Fill Rate), and OTIF% (On Time In Full). This analysis aims to understand patterns and connections between these vital indicators through graphs and calculations in order to optimise the FMCG supply chain.

## Key Performance Indicator(KPIs)  Explained

1. LIFR(Line Fill Rate) - LIFR represents the percentage of orders filled completely without any shortages or backorders.
                          A high LIFR indicates efficient order fulfillment, ensuring customers receive their complete orders on time.

2. VOFR(Volume Fill Rate) - VOFR measures the percentage of ordered volume or quantity that is successfully delivered.
                          A high VOFR signifies the ability to meet demand and efficiently deliver the requested quantities.

3. OT%(On Time Delivery) - OT% calculates the percentage of orders delivered on or before the scheduled delivery date.
                           A high OT% reflects reliability in meeting delivery deadlines and customer expectations.

4. IF%(In Full Delivery)  -  IF% measures the percentage of orders delivered in full without any missing items.
                           A high IF% indicates that orders are consistently delivered without shortages or missing products.

5. OTIF%(On Time In Full) - OTIF% combines both on-time delivery and in-full delivery metrics to assess overall supply chain performance.
                           A high OTIF% indicates a reliable and efficient supply chain that meets delivery deadlines and fulfills orders completely.

## Insights 
1. At 52.78% IF% is currently 23.73 away from the target of 76.51%.

2. At 59.03% OT% is currently 27.05% away from the target 86.09%.

3. At 29.02 %, OTIF is currently 36.89 % away from the target of 65.91%.

4.  3 customers 'Cool Blue', 'Acclaimed Stores', 'Lotus Mart' , need attention as they have horrible OTIF % which might lead to non-renewal 
     contract and business loss.

5. City wise, all cities are equally distant from the target of respective KPI's.

6. Total Quantity Ordered and Total Quantity Delivered , differ  by 0.43 M .

7. Overall VOFR % looks good. But LIFR % needs to be pulled up.

8. Monthly analysis of VOFR % was low in June and LIFR % was High in August.

# [Project - 3: Telangana State Challans and Revenue Analysis ](https://jigneshs6701.github.io/Jignesh_Sharma_Portfolio/)

## Description 
This project will examine challans and revenue data in Telangana, with a focus on document registration and e-stamp challans. We seek to gain valuable insights into revenue trends and patterns within the state by using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Revenue Growth Rate (%), Revenue Ratio, and Count Pattern Change (%).

## Key Performance Indicator(KPIs)  Explained

1. Revenue Growth Rate (%) - The Revenue Growth Rate measures the percentage change in revenue between FY 2019 and FY 2022
                             This KPI provides insights into how revenue has evolved over the specified period, helping to identify districts with substantial revenue growth or decline.

2. Revenue Ratio ( Document Registration Revenue / E-stamps challan Revenue) - The Revenue Ratio compares the revenue generated from document registration to that from e-stamp challans.
                                                                               It enables us to understand the relative contribution of document registration and e-stamp challans to the overall revenue. This                                                                                   is particularly useful for highlighting districts where e-stamps play a more significant role.

3. Count Pattern Change (%) - Count Pattern Change measures the percentage change in e-stamp challan count since the implementation of e-stamp challans.
                              This KPI helps us identify if there has been a significant alteration in the count pattern of e-stamp challans, potentially indicating changes in user behavior or government       
                               policies.

## Insights

1. Rangareddy district has the most Document Registered Challans and E Challans, and it also generates the most revenue from Challans.

2. Rangareddy, Medchal Malkajgiri, Hyderabad, Sangareddy, and Hanumakonda are the top 5 districts that experienced the greatest growth in document registration revenue between FY 2019 and 2022.

3. In 2021, E-stamp challans generated more revenue than Document registered challans. 

4.  Except for one district, Kumurambheem Asifabad , every district has a high number of counts in E challans in 2022, resulting in higher revenue in E - stamp challans compared to Document Registered challans.

5.  Segregated districts into three categories based on revenue in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, with the highest revenue being 179 billions among 14 districts, the mid-average revenue being around 10 billion 
    among 11 districts, and the lowest revenue being around 4 billion among 8 districts.
