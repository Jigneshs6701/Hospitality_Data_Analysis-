# [Project - 1: Hospitality Data Analysis](https://jigneshs6701.github.io/Jignesh_Sharma_Portfolio/)

## Description :
This self-driven hospitality project makes use of the power of POWER BI and Excel to uncover revenue opportunities. The project examines online data to identify key indicators such as RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy%, Realisation%, RevPar, DBRN, DSRN, and DURN. The findings of this study pave the way for more effective revenue strategies in the hospitality industry.

## Key Performance Indicator Explained 

1. Occupancy % - Occupancy % represents the percentage of available rooms that are occupied by guests.
                 A higher occupancy rate indicates better utilization of hotel rooms and increased revenue potential.

2. ADR (Average Daily Rate) -  ADR is the average rate charged per room, typically calculated as total room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold.
                                A high ADR reflects the pricing strategy's effectiveness and the hotel's ability to command higher room rates.

3. Realisation % - Realisation % compares the actual revenue earned to the maximum potential revenue under ideal conditions.
                   A high realisation percentage signifies efficient revenue management practices.

4. RevPar(Revenue Per Available Room) - RevPar is calculated by multiplying ADR by Occupancy % and indicates the revenue generated per available room.
                                        A higher RevPar indicates both pricing and occupancy performance.

 5. DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights) - DBRN tells on average how many rooms are booked for a day considering a time period and it is calculated by Dividing Total Bookings to No of Days 

 6. DURN(Daily Usable Room Nights) - DURB tells on average how many are succesfully utilized by customer for a day considering a time period and it is calculated Total Checked Out

Project Overview: 

  1. Through data analysis using Power BI and Excel, the FMCG department can address supply chain issues.
  2. Utilized critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as OT% (On-Time Delivery), IF% (Inventory Fill Rate), and OTIF% (On-Time-In-Full) sourced from online data.

Analysis Approach:
  1. Comparative Analysis: Conducted a comparative analysis of these KPIs to assess supply chain performance.
  2. Data Visualisation: Graphs and visualisations were used to demonstrate trends and correlations among key indicators.
  3. Statistical Insights: Employed calculations and statistical methods to gain insights into patterns within the supply chain.
  4. Performance Patterns: Explored how well the supply chain was functioning and identified areas for improvement.
