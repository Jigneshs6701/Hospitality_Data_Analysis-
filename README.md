# [Project - 1: Hospitality Data Analysis](https://jigneshs6701.github.io/Jignesh_Sharma_Portfolio/)

## Description :
This self-driven hospitality project makes use of the power of POWER BI and Excel to uncover revenue opportunities. The project examines online data to identify key indicators such as RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy%, Realisation%, RevPar, DBRN, DSRN, and DURN. The findings of this study pave the way for more effective revenue strategies in the hospitality industry.

## Key Performance Indicator(KPIs)  Explained 

1. Occupancy % - Occupancy % represents the percentage of available rooms that are occupied by guests.
                 A higher occupancy rate indicates better utilization of hotel rooms and increased revenue potential.

2. ADR (Average Daily Rate) -  ADR is the average rate charged per room, typically calculated as total room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold.
                                A high ADR reflects the pricing strategy's effectiveness and the hotel's ability to command higher room rates.

3. Realisation % - Realisation % compares the actual revenue earned to the maximum potential revenue under ideal conditions.
                   A high realisation percentage signifies efficient revenue management practices.

4. RevPar(Revenue Per Available Room) - RevPar is calculated by multiplying ADR by Occupancy % and indicates the revenue generated per available room.
                                        A higher RevPar indicates both pricing and occupancy performance.

 5. DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights) - DBRN tells on average how many rooms are booked for a day considering a time period and it is calculated by Dividing Total Bookings to No of Days.

 6. DURN(Daily Usable Room Nights) - DURB tells on average how many are succesfully utilized by customer for a day considering a time period and it is calculated Total Checked Out to No of Days.

 7. DSRN(Daily Sellable Room Nights) - DSRN tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period and it is calculated dividing Total Capacity to No of Days.

# [Project - 2: FMCG Supply Chain Analysis with Power BI and Excel ](https://jigneshs6701.github.io/Jignesh_Sharma_Portfolio/)

## Description 

To address supply chain issues, this self-driven project in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) department uses POWER BI and Excel. The project analyses online data to determine key performance indicators (KPIs) such as OT%, IF%, LIFR (Line Fill Rate), VOFR (Volume Fill Rate), and OTIF% (On Time In Full). This analysis aims to understand patterns and connections between these vital indicators through graphs and calculations in order to optimise the FMCG supply chain.

## Key Performance Indicator(KPIs)  Explained

1. LIFR(Line Fill Rate) - LIFR represents the percentage of orders filled completely without any shortages or backorders.
                          A high LIFR indicates efficient order fulfillment, ensuring customers receive their complete orders on time.

2. VOFR(Volume Fill Rate) - VOFR measures the percentage of ordered volume or quantity that is successfully delivered.
                          A high VOFR signifies the ability to meet demand and efficiently deliver the requested quantities.

3. OT%(On Time Delivery) - OT% calculates the percentage of orders delivered on or before the scheduled delivery date.
                           A high OT% reflects reliability in meeting delivery deadlines and customer expectations.

4. IF%(In Full Delivery)  -  IF% measures the percentage of orders delivered in full without any missing items.
                           A high IF% indicates that orders are consistently delivered without shortages or missing products.

5. OTIF%(On Time In Full) - OTIF% combines both on-time delivery and in-full delivery metrics to assess overall supply chain performance.
                           A high OTIF% indicates a reliable and efficient supply chain that meets delivery deadlines and fulfills orders completely.
